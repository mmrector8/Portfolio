## Previous Careers and How They Help Me Be the Best Engineer I Can Be

  Before becoming a software engineer, I worked in a variety of careers, including: Marine Science Research and Education, Operations at Tesla, and as a High School Science Teacher and Director of Student Activities. While it is hard to pinpoint just a few things I learned at these jobs, the below is my best attempt to do so: 
  
* From **marine science**, I realized my passion for **data analysis** and how powerful numbers can be. I also realized my passion for conservation, which has allowed me to keep **Green Software Engineering** practices at the forefront of my mind always.
  
* From Tesla, I learned about the **power of technology and software** and the value of working on a **cohesive team that values each other's opinions**.
  
* From working as a science teacher, I learned how to be **adaptable and pick up new skills quickly**. 

### Hobbies

When I am not busy programming, I enjoy wildlife photography, SCUBA diving, ceramics, hiking, running, volleyball, and skiing! I love to spend the weekends outdoors or in the ceramics studio.
